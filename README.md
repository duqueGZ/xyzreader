# xyzreader
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. Project 5: "Make Your App Material"

### Resume of the improvements applied to the original XYZ Reader app:

* Update gradle and used libraries versions, and also min, target and compile SDK versions.
* Included the use of the Design Support Library (and its widgets, such as "CollapsingToolbarLayout", "FloatingActionButton"...).
* Changed the app style theme and colors, in order to make it more colourful and nice to the user.
* Removed the use of non-default fonts, and reviewed the colors of the different texts in the app, in order to make them consistent with the rest of the contents.
* Customized the text shared with the Share action (FAB button in detail activity), in order to make it different for each article.
* Improved the use of images (and elevations, margins and other dimensions), in order to achive a more immersive experience for the user.
* Included the support for internationalization of the strings in the app.
* Removed several resources and classes not used after all the refactorizations and changes made.
